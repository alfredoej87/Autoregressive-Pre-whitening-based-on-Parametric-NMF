%%Pre-whitening a noisy signal
%%input signal is assumed as signal = cleanSignal+noise 

%%Requires: voicebox  http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html
%%Uses voicebox functions: enframe and overlapadd

%%Example from using the default setting parameters.  

%y = audioread('keele2addedbabbleat5dB.wav'); 
%noisy_nmf_prewhitened = arPrewhitenNoisySignal(y); 
%%for some noise scenarios it is suggested to do training on similar noise
%%types, 
%%it is also recommended to input the parameters for a specific application
