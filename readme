%%Pre-whitening a noisy signal
%%input signal is assumed as signal = cleanSignal+noise 

%%This pre-whitener is useful as a pre-processor for: 
%%(a) WGN based estimator, such as the Fast NLS pitch estimator (https://github.com/jkjaer/fastF0Nls). 
In this case the solution can be post-processed and improved from an iterative refinement (https://github.com/alfredoesquivelaudioaau/iterativeF0Ar_NLS) 
%%(b) In some scenarios (i.e., noise types at certain iSNRs) of some non-parametric pitch estimators (e.g., SWIPE'), instead of applying what is regardly seen as the 
convenient way to deal with noise (speech enhancement) 

%%In non-stationary noise (e.g., babble or restaurant) a better performance (noise whiteness, best pitch estimation accuracy) is obtained from training a noise codebook of 256
%entries. We observed better performance from a speech codebook of 32 entries. In stationary noise (e.g., F-16, factory), a noise codebook of 16 entries. 
%%Requires: voicebox functions: enframe and overlapadd, which are readily uploaded 

%%Example from using the default setting parameters.  

%y = audioread('keele2addedbabbleat5dB.wav'); 
%noisy_nmf_prewhitened = arPrewhitenNoisySignal(y); 
%%for some noise scenarios it is suggested to do training on similar noise types, it is also recommended to input the parameters for a specific application

At very low SNRs in very non-stationary noise (e.g., babble or restaurant), pre-whitening followed by NLS pitch estimates leads to the best performance in terms of FFE (including gross errors and
voicing detections) even as compared to a joint estimator (in case one is interested in better accuracy). Although such result was not reported yet in a paper, I hope I can update such results in this repo.
