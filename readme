%%Pre-whitening a noisy signal
%%input signal is assumed as signal = cleanSignal+noise 

%%This pre-whitener is useful as a pre-processor for: 
%%(a) WGN based estimator, such as the Fast NLS pitch estimator (https://github.com/jkjaer/fastF0Nls). 
In this case the solution can be further improved from using an iterative refinement (https://github.com/alfredoesquivelaudioaau/iterativeF0Ar_NLS) 
%%(b) In some scenarios (i.e., noise types) of some non-parametric pitch estimators (e.g., SWIPE') 

%%In non-stationary noise (e.g., babble or restaurant) a better performance (noise whiteness, best pitch estimation accuracy) is obtained from 
%%training a codebook of 256 entries. 

%%Requires: voicebox  http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html
%%Uses voicebox functions: enframe and overlapadd

%%Example from using the default setting parameters.  

%y = audioread('keele2addedbabbleat5dB.wav'); 
%noisy_nmf_prewhitened = arPrewhitenNoisySignal(y); 
%%for some noise scenarios it is suggested to do training on similar noise
%%types, 
%%it is also recommended to input the parameters for a specific application
